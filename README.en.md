## 👋 Introduction and Ambition ✨
- This is my Gatsby Blog named [**Hagyeong-Log**](https://hagyeonglee.github.io). 
- 🧗‍♀️ With a record that I want to draw a good growth narrative, I will run this blog so that it can contain stories that I learn, fail, and grow well in the future.🙌 
- I used the existing technology blog to scribble on my own, but I completed the ideal development blog that I drew little by little through Gatsby. 
- I will continue to write paper reviews, make book reports, and record various things I studied and failed experiences.⛱️ 
- 😛 Please come and see my records😃
